			- ping
			- operation server selection
			- ....			
		- debug
	- Goal is to make it easy to plug your own processor, should also be possible 	to change the level of debugging on the fly if needed

- Integra test suite code coverage
	- Normal code coverage
	- Reversed code coverage

- Extending benchmark suite
	- Better coverage of critical path
	- Profiling of critical path

- Functional tests running against
	- Single server
	- Replicaset
	- Sharded

- Rework docs to be better and nicer
	- Refactor tools code into cleaner code
	- Better design of code location
	- Ensure analytics is used for this

- Redesign BSON interface to be more pluggable
	- Single method entry instead of like now
	- Support pre-allocated buffers for both C++ and js BSON by option

- Fix Kerberos module to compile correctly against Node 0.12.0 on unix/win32

- Fix BSON module to compile correctly against Node 0.12.0 on unix/win32

- Figure out Windows binaries packaging and loading logic in bson library
	- 64bit/32bit
	- Node 0.10.X vs 0.12.X
	- win7 vs win8 ? (not sure if this is a problem)

- BsonRegExp Class introduction to BSON
